# Early-Detection-od-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-CNN-and-Watershed-algorithm
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) — a diabetes complication that affects the eyes — using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Watershed Image Segmentation Algorithm.
